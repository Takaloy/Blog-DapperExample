## Requirements
You'll need visual studio to go through this example. I'd recommend that you use visual studio community edition, which can be found [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).

The project uses two main nuget packages, Dapper dot net and Sqlite.
